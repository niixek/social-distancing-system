# Social Distancing System

This project was created for the CSE 321 class at the University at Buffalo.

This system will detect if a person is at least 6 feet away from the system, as this is the recommended minimum distance from the CDC. If the person is closer than 6 feet, a buzzer will sound and the LCD will display to tell the person to back up. There is an adjustable knob to allow adjustable distance for the system.

Project created by Kexin Chen and Siquan Wang.
