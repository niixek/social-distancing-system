/**
* Authors: Kexin Chen and Siquan Wang
* Purpose: A system that can detect the distance between a person and the system
* Extra Modules/Functions in File: QEI by Aaron Berk
* Assignment: Project 3
*********************************************************
* Inputs: Ultrasonic sensor, Rotary Encoder
* Outputs: Buzzer, LCD Display
* Constraints: Must keep the distance between 2 to 400 cm
               Adjustable distance is only adjusted by rotary encoder
               Ultrasonic sensor must have direct path to object
               Buzzer must be loud, but not too loud
               Must have response regarding object's distance to system on LCD
